    var last_name = "Gates";
    console.log(last_name);
    var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log(full_name);
    var length = full_name.length;
    console.log(length);
    var name1 = "Hi I am Bill Gates";
    console.log(name1);
    var rep_name = name1. replace("Bill Gates", "Mark Zuckerberg");
    console.log(rep_name); 
    var CN = "MARK ZUCKERBERG";
    var lower_case = CN.toLowerCase();
    console.log(lower_case);
    var a = 567;
    console.log(a)
    var b = 1003;
    console.log(b)
    var add = a + b ;
    console.log(add);
    var subtract = b - a;
    console.log(subtract);
    var multiply = a * b;
    console.log(multiply);
    var divide = b/a;
    console.log(divide)
